## 📒 About <a name="about"></a>

I was learning programming in R (2020) and this is when I did this project. I used a kaggle dataset - to perform the analysis. 

As south-korean government in the inital phase of Covid-19 was able to curb the infections pretty quickly. The analysis was done to find the reasons as to what measures led to decline in the infection rate.

## 👨‍💻 Configuration Requirements <a name="configuration-requirements"></a>

What is the required configuration for running this code
1. OS requirements - Any
2. Must have R-studio installed https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

## 🖥️ Installation <a name="installation"></a>

1. Download R-studio
2. Load the .rmd file
3. Have a look at the code and analysis

## Key-Findings <a name="key"></a>

1. People above 60 had a significantly higher risk of mortality compared to people below 60
2. Drive-through testing centers helped the South Korean government to efficiently assess the realisted spread of Covid-19 throughout the population
3. Social Distancing Campaigns proved effective
4. Adaptive policies by government based on local situation prooved fruitful

Verdict: The south korean government learned and consequently was able to take more precise mreasures over time and hence resulted in curbing the first wave of infection better than most other countries.
